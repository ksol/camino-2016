This was the day things started to get serious. We were at an altitude of a little bit more than 600m, and by the end of the day we had planned to be around 2000. We decided the days before not to follow the official route through the Somport peak, but to go off track. We wanted to see more moutains, better landscapes, and we also craved the challenge.

The plan was to get to the Lac d'Arlet, and if it wasn't a good place to plant the tent, find a refuge. The beginning of the walk was quite steep and hard. I remember being sweaty and panting most of the time. But before 10h, we were around 1000m. We met two hikers (not pilgrims) who intended to go the same place as us. They told us that the refuge was closed, but that there should be a room left open, with beds and blankets. It sounded way better than the tent.

Next part was a valley. It was going up still, but not as steep as before, and it was very enjoyable. Loïc was behind, but only because he was too busy eating berries all the time. His ankle was not troubling him any more, and my blisters were a distant memory. We felt as good as we could, and it was well needed for that day.

We took our lunch break right before the end of the valley, and what came next was pretty steep and hard. We had trouble finding the right path and went the wrong way a couple of times. At some point, we just sucked it up and kept going, even though it was the steepest road I had ever climbed. I had to take breaks every 30 seconds to catch my break... I was a bit scared for knees. They had been holding up pretty well until then, but that part was more demanding than anything we'd done until then.

And at some point, it slowed down a bit. It was still steep, but less, and with flat portions here and there. I remember getting quite tired and cold, and I wanted to take a break but Loïc was a bit ahead and I didn't felt like losing sight of him, so I kept going. Until after a turn, I noticed and lake and realized we had made it !

And it lasted for about five minutes. After that, there was a cloud right over the lake and we couldn't see it any longer. We barely had time to enjoy it... The walk before it was beautiful though. The hikers we had met earlier arrived right after us, and indeed the refuse had a winter room that was opened. And so... we started by taking a three-hour nap until 18/19h.It was freaking cold: I remember sleeping under three blankets and still not feeling warm enough.

Once we managed to wake up from our nap, we ate and talked with the hikers. One of them was hellbent on sleeping in the tent despite the cold: he only took a few blankets with him.
