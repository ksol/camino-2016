A piece of advice for anyone taking a bus: don't take for granted that they'll have restrooms on board. I assumed mine would and well, let's just say the mid-road break was more than welcome.

The road to [Porto](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/Porto,+Portugal/@41.162928,-8.6569583,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xd2465abc4e153c1:0xa648d95640b114bc!8m2!3d41.1579783!4d-8.6290741?hl=fr) was nice. After a good week of grey weather it was finally sunny again. The blue of the sky made the autumn mountains look beautiful, and here and there you could see the ocean. We stopped at [Pontevedra](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/Pontevedra,+Province+de+Pontevedra,+Espagne/@42.4338911,-8.6568982,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xd2f71cf339da6d7:0x6d5b163a1be431d4!8m2!3d42.4300454!4d-8.6448669?hl=fr), and from what I glimpsed of the city through the bus windows, the city looks beautiful.

I arrived in Porto around 16h, with enough time to check in my hostel and take a quick tour of the city before exhaustion settled in. The city was quite alive, with people everywhere, live music on the street. The bridge next to the castle offers a pretty amazing view over the bay, and with the setting sun it made for a lovely sight.

The next day, I was woken up by one asshole who took a phone call around 8 inside the dorm and didn't even try to talk with a lower voice. I'm pretty sure I'd rather have people snoring; at least they don't do it on purpose. I spoke a bit with a couple of travelers from Mexico, the girl being a student abroad in Strasbourg! The world can be quite small from time to time.

From there, I had planned on walking as far as I could towards the ocean. After an hour of walk I felt that I had seen enough, and I tried to find a way to go to the other side of the bay but from where I was, there wasn't any way for pedestrians, so I walked back to my hostel, once again very tired.

My initial plan was to hop from city to city: Porto, Lisboa, Faro, Seville, Madrid, Barcelona, maybe Toulouse... but I quickly realized that I wasn't willing to travel anymore. I think I had my share. I wasn't able to enjoy Porto to its fullest and I didn't think it would improve, so it was time to go home.

I booked a plane ticket for the next day, even though I hate those things, and an airbnb in Paris right way. It was only once everything was booked that I noticed I took a ticket for the wrong date: my flight was scheduled for the 14th of december, one month away. So that's why the tickets were so cheap... I spent about an hour trying to find an alternate plan, and the best I came up with was to go to [Lisbon](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/Lisbonne,+Portugal/@38.7437395,-9.2304155,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xd19331a61e4f33b:0x400ebbde49036d0!8m2!3d38.7219476!4d-9.1392517?hl=fr) for two more days and take a plan from there. I spent the rest of the day being so annoyed by myself that I didn't do anything and stayed at the hostel, reading and watching stuff on my phone.

The next day, I took the train from Porto to Lisbon. The sights were once again quite nice, between the ocean and the mountains. The ocean was actually a two minutes walk out of the station, and right there was a old ship, but the buildings next to it were blocking the view. I walked to my hostel and it was only once I was in front of it that I noticed its name: "The G-Spot". Everybody was very welcoming there: I had barely arrived that I had a beer in my hand and was invited to try the cocktails they were making.

We had dinner together as well, then drank some more and played beer pong. I was even winning and almost ended up champion of the night! We then got out to enjoy the nightlife even though it was early in the week. Lisbon seems like a good student town, with lots of bars and young people. I woke up a little hungover the next day...

I spent the morning slacking off at the hostel and the early afternoon walking around the city. At somepoint I found a cafe to read, after what I went back to hostel and talked with the residents around wine and dinner. I skipped the bar hopping that night: I didn't want to be hungover for my flight the next day.

It's quite easy to get from the center of Lisbon to its airport and quick as well. Even the flight was not that bad! Once I got out of the airport in Paris though, it struck me: I was back. Everybody was speaking French, and that felt odd for a couple of minutes. And obviously, it was raining! But nonetheless, it was good to be back. In the end, I spent two nights in Porto, two nights in Lisbon, and two nights in Paris. On the seven day, I came home to Strasbourg.

I had told almost nobody that I was coming back, so nobody expected me. I dropped my stuff at a friend's place, then went out for a quick beer at my usual bar. A few friends of mine had a band and they were releasing their first EP that night, so that's where I headed after. I arrived right at the end of the gig, with almost nobody noticing me there until I was right in front of them. Between the hoodie and the beard, I guess that was to be expected! Once it was over, I reunited with everybody and I was officially back.
