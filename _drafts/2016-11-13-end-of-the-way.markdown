I woke up way too early, around 8. I was not fully rested but once again, my body had found its rythm... I kept hearing Loïc banging himself on the wall next to his bed and he was unable to turn off his alarm: he was still quite drunk and would be nursing a massive hangover that day.

When I got out of the rooms, Jose jumped on me right away: he couldn't find the bar from last night, where he had left his stuff. He told me they kicked him out without letting him get them first, then he was out all night in the cold and somehow he fell down and had a scar on his head... I was getting fed up with his shit but this time I didn't have to walk with him. If there's one thing I wasn't going to miss from the camino, it's having to deal with him. He wasn't a bad person, but really unable to account for himself, from what I could see.

I left the hotel with Loïc still asleep, knowing that I wouldn't be seeing him until quite some time. But somehow, it felt very appropriate to leave him without saying goodbye because he was to drunk to do so: those who know him will probably agree! I ran into Jenny one last time, then went for a coffee with Krista and Saula.

After one last session of hugs and goodbyes, it was time for me to go to the bus station and leave the camino behind.
