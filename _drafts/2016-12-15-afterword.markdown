So, here we are. I had no idea it would take me so much time to put all of my notes and memories in a coherent form, but here it is, and now it's time for self-reflection. This afterword is very much the product of the past couple of months and the current state of the world; let's hope I can come back to it in a couple of years and tell myself that damn, things have changed for the better.

But first things first: yeah, I enjoyed the shit out of this trip. I've done it because I wanted to go out of my comfort zone and to undertake a physical challenge and I feel like I achieved both. On top of it I met great people, some of them I hope to see again at some point. If you have any reservation about going through this kind of trip, please, do yourself a favor and go for it.

<hr>

Since I came back, people kept asking me if I had seen the light, found god or something of the kind, and I keep answering them, tongue in cheek, that nothing of the sort happened, and that I might actually be a worse person than I was before.

As with most things in life, there is a small measure of truth in it. When you walk the camino, you are constantly reminded of all that is good about people: we share, we help, we talk, we support, we try to understand, we overcome our challenges and differences, we push ourselves further than our limits...

And _we care_. I sincerely cared for the pilgrims I've met during this trip, and I believe they cared about me, too, however short in time or small in scope it was. And if that was not enough, you see saw many writings on the road, on signs, under brides, wooden structures, [even walls]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2016-10-28-mansilla-de-las-mulas.markdown %}), all being messages of love or inspiration.

And despite all that, while I was walking, people in Syria still got killed, Donald Trump still got elected on a platform of hate and sheer stupidity, and there has to be countless occurences of such events that happened during those 50 days. It may sound dumb, but the US election, process and result, made an impact on my experience.

What I take back with me from this trip is something we all know to be true, and yet most of us, I being the first, try to ignore it because it makes things easier. It is *not* enough to write inspiring stuff on walls or on facebook. And as good as it is, It belive it is *not* enough to help and care for those we like. It is *not* enough to care care for those we do not yet dislike.

The hard and necessary work resides in engaging those we do not like. Those who opinions that we might qualify as toxic. Those that spread hatred and sow mistrust of the other.

Sometimes it will mean extending an hand, sometimes it will mean making a stand. I would consider myself to be quite progressive and most of my friends are too. Most of the people I met during this trip were, too; I'd go as far as to say _good people_. And I think we all know at least one person whom we disagree with. It may be an uncle who always makes sexist jokes at family dinner "because it's good fun"; it may be a friend that is not racist "but come on, the immigrants have it better and it's at our expense!"; it takes many faces and we all know some of them.

And we avoid them. Because we feel it's not worth the energy. Why would I spend time explaining to my uncle that no, it's not ok to tell victimes of rape that they had to dress less lightly? He wouldn't listen to me anyway and we would be tense and it would be for nothing. Why would I risk losing a friend from childhood? I mean, I gotta understand his point of view, he lost his job and there's a family of syrians next door, with seven children and they do not work and they have no troubles in the world!

People with strong opinions will stand for them and fight for them, simple as that. People who believe immigrants are taking their job feel that they have a stake in what's happening and therefore will fight to get their jobs back and kick immigrants out. People who believe, even inconsciously that women are second class to men will feel threatened each time a women proves his vision wrong, and therefore will push, even inconsciously, to put them back "in their right place".

But most of us, and by us I mostly white men, we have no stakes in these fights. So we avoid the fights because they're not ours, while the ones with the "bad ideas" fight for what they believe. All of us beholder of privilege, be it because of skin color, religion, gender, or nationality, needs to start acknowledging that privilege and most of all, to stop reaping the benefits of it without fighting to level the ground for everybody. It's our responsability. We didn't chose it but then again, so didn't the "unprivileged".

It looks I digressed but I really don't think I have. What I take back from my camino is that while it is good to care, we need to go one step further and engage and resist.
