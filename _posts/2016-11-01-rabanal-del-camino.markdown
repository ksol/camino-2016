We woke up as the sun was rising. The first part of the way wasn't very fun, but it was the first time in many days that I was walking with Loïc again. We caught a bit with the events of the previous days, and we reached [Astorga](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/Astorga,+Le%C3%B3n,+Espagne/@42.4583011,-6.0720275,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xd3760bb69ce14d7:0x8e1c28c4cc84cc7d!8m2!3d42.4549378!4d-6.0532093?hl=fr) before the end of the morning. He was also enjoying being less surrounded with people and was feeling like doing long days to reach Santiago quickly. Once there, he would see whether he felt like waiting for some friends or moving on alone.

Nonetheless, Astorga felt like it wanted us to stay: we were at two places and each time the music was great and made us want to stay until the end of the track, and the next track did the same. More than that, the place had a good vibe to it. We had found this cafe called Sonrisa (if my memory is good), and the staff was so smiling and happy! One of them was a photographer: you can see the result of his work below.

Loïc was getting ready to leave, and right at this moment he stumbled upon Paul so stayed there for half an hour more. What was intially a short break lasted longer than expected... But at the some point, we all felt it was time to move on. Maybe it was due to Queen's _The Show must go on_ being played a little earlier.

I knew that Krista and Saula had planned on staying in Astorga that day, and part of me wanted to stay there to see them again, but also to have a chat with Brice, the root of all dramas. I knew that I should have let it go but the whole thing bothered me. It felt wrong on all levels that he got to get away with being a dick and I wanted to settled it. But I shoved that aside, and we started walking with Loïc and Paul. We took a break around noon for lunch, and right after we left, Monica told me (by text) that Brice had left the Camino.

Boy, was I pissed. I was robbed of my revenge! My nemesis was gone before I could... well, I don't know what I would have done or if I'd have done anything, really, but the choice was now out of my hands. I was overdoing the whole thing for the sake of entertainment, but it truly bothered me in a way. I took off my frustration on a stick that I ended up breaking, and after that I walked fast until I reached [Rabanal del Camino](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/24722+Rabanal+del+Camino,+Le%C3%B3n,+Espagne/@42.4817319,-6.2856533,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xd37511e9d397559:0x7114b2c8b4257b1b!8m2!3d42.4810862!4d-6.2846947?hl=fr), joined shortly after by Loïc and Paul.

We had started being in mountains again. They both had planned on going further away but it was already late in the afternoon, so they eneded up staying there. We went to our albergue, a very nice place, halfway between modern and classic. Once again, except the three of us I knew none of the pilgrims that were staying there. Jess was playing music on her phone, the same kind that we had in Astorga. The same kind that we liked :) She also had made a lot of soup for everybody. Between her and Paul who had bought me lunch and a round of beers that night, I felt like everybody was taking care of me. A bit overwhelming at times!
