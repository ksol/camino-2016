Travelog is a theme for Jekyll that is both elegant and downright simple.

In addition to being devilishly handsome, it is responsive down to mobile and has a very light footprint. Travelog lends itself well to photography and travel journaling.

Like a backpack with too many straps, a blog can sometimes be frustrating when it has too many bells and whistles. It is with that philosophy that I have put together this theme so that you might drown in its whitespace.
