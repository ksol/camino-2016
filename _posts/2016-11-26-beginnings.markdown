<h1> Day 1 </h1>
<h2> 22/09 — Toulouse — Lac de la Bordette </h2>

After two days spent in [Paris](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/Paris/@48.8589507,2.2775172,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47e66e1f06e2b70f:0x40b82c3688c9460!8m2!3d48.856614!4d2.3522219?hl=fr) and one day in [Toulouse](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/Toulouse/@43.6008029,1.3628011,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x12aebb6fec7552ff:0x406f69c2f411030!8m2!3d43.604652!4d1.444209?hl=fr), it was finally time to start the actual walk. My notes for the first week are very brief, so I have to rely on my memory for this section, and we're talking about events that happend two months ago. Still, I remember a few things about the first day. Mostly, the neverending suburbs. Loïc and I were very excited and restless to start our hike, but after two hours spent walking in [Toulouse](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/Toulouse/@43.6008029,1.3628011,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x12aebb6fec7552ff:0x406f69c2f411030!8m2!3d43.604652!4d1.444209?hl=fr) and its surrounding cities, the excitation was mostly gone.

There was a few parks here and there though, and we had enough to talk about to not think about the dam under our feet. It was around midday that we thought about a project that we never got around to do, but that made us laugh for a while. During our test hike, we noticed that canned tuna salads were cheap, good enough (as far as canned food goes) and nutricient, so it had became our favourite choice of food on the go.

And while we were having our lunch (or was it dinner?) break, we thought about making a youtube channel of testing canned tuna salads, comparing brands and tastes, giving them grades, eventually going as far as making partnerships with the brands once we'd have a good following... It would have been a fun way to let our friends know that we were doing alright and where we were without actually having to talk to them. We even thought of the background music :

But laziness and the lack of proper editing material got in our way. We're still convinced it would have been a hit, though.

So, our route took us through [Toulouse](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/Toulouse/@43.6008029,1.3628011,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x12aebb6fec7552ff:0x406f69c2f411030!8m2!3d43.604652!4d1.444209?hl=fr) and [Blagnac](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/31700+Blagnac/@43.6410098,1.3420066,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x12aea5317078e255:0xfeb61ad68d97a759!8m2!3d43.635087!4d1.39703?hl=fr) and then around the airport. While the walk was not fun, seeing planes land and take off from up close is always something that will impress me. We passed very close to the airbus museum, too, with some interesting old planes on the ground. In the beginning or middle of the afternoon, we arrived in [Pibrac](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/Pibrac/@43.6245503,1.2233496,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x12aeb21e6d1a173b:0xe9c03f78f2c62365!8m2!3d43.618937!4d1.283406?hl=fr) and took our first coffee break of the day.

From there, the rest of the day is hazy, but I remember it started being harder. Muscles were tired, since our bodies were not yet used to walking with heavy backpacks (around 15Kg at that point, when we had a few cans and full bottles of water). On top of that, the sun was quite strong. Not that I mind it, but it doesn't help with exhaustion. Around the end of the afternoon I started having my first blister, on the side of the right foot. I didn't expect it since I had no issue during the test hike, but walking in city streets all day got to my feet, I think.

But we pushed through and walked some more to find a nice spot to plant our tent. The first two spots were less than ideal, so we walked and walked some more and settled for the [Lac de la Bordette](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lac+de+la+Bordette/@43.6400999,1.2262408,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x12aead5cd03552a3:0xc1091275eb17b56c!8m2!3d43.6404025!4d1.2282063?hl=en).

The spot was quite nice, but we arrived there quite late (around 19h), so I didn't think about taking pictures. I remember being quite happy because my phone told me that we walked 47Kms... Which cannot possibly be true, looking at the map. Best case, we did between 35 and 40, which might have been too much for a first day. Here is a recap of the route we took:
