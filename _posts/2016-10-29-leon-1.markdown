I slept like a well-behaved baby that night. I took my breakfast and waited for Loïc to be ready while everyone was leaving, which was useless: he was sore from his run of the day earlier and couldn't walk at a decent pace again. I sticked with him a little but it was actually hard to slow down to his pace, so I went ahead, passing by friends and stopping only when I caught up to Krista, Saula and Jem.

After a coffee break, I kept going with Jone. I had first met her in Burgos where she joined a friend of hers, Marina, who was spanish but that I always saw with the group of Italians. No, it's not that complicated :) She was part of the group that stayed at the albergue the previous night, and it happened that we enjoyed talking and walking with each other, with pretty much the same pace.

We arrived at the entrance of [León](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/Le%C3%B3n,+Espagne/@42.6036359,-5.5949438,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xd379a9a0d5e1bd9:0x7d849ffad4f1eef3!8m2!3d42.5987137!4d-5.5671501?hl=fr) around noon and we sat in a park, waiting for the others to catch up, but they were tooking too much time. So after a beer we went to the main albergue. She checked in and I hesitated, not sure wether I wanted to check in there or find another place.

With a few others, we had talked about booking a large airbnb to accomodate many of us and allow us to go out without restrictions, but short of going into a hostel we didn't find anything that was suitable. In the end, almost everybody (including myself) checked into the main albergue, save for Monica, Sacha and Paul who went to another one with less restrictions. In hindsight, that's where I should have gone to, but in way, I did... More on that later.

Once everybody checked in, with Jose, Loic, Jone and later Christian we went for a tapas-athon: one bar, one beer, one tapas, and fifteen minutes later we do the same thing but in another bar. León felt more alive than any other town we had stayed in until then, but maybe it was because for once, we had some sun !

After five bars, Jone and I were quite tired and went back to the albergue for a nap. After a shower, I joined a few others for drinks and that was the gist of the night: pilgrims met randomly in bars. It was saturday night and many people were already celebrating halloween so the city was overran with joyful people. We kept doing that until we got close to the curfew. Only the pilgrims of the other albergue stayed out, as well as Loïc and Christian who didn't care much about spending the night outside, or had faith in finding a late-minute host.

The return to the albergue felt like losing a battle. Many of us still felt going out and having fun, but the albergue was closed and the hospitaleros were doing their job and made us stay quiet. I was still quite awake, though, and Monica was texting me to convince me to go out and that she would host me, having a spare bed in her room. I declined at first, but eventually I got up and dressed and try to see if there was a way out. I ran into a few of the italians and Yutaka, a japanese pilgrim. They had found a way out through the hotel next door, but the security had told them that they once they were out, they wouldn't be able to come back in until 6, so they gave up.

I didn't care, though, and neither did Yutaka, so we went out. It felt really exciting to "jump the wall", something I'd never done when I was younger. Yutaka had no backup plan and didn't care: all he wanted to do was to go out, have fun and dance. We found Loïc, Isabel and a few others and then joined the rest of the group. They were hanging at the bar right in front of the albergue, and I could see the windows without any light, aware that there were a few people in there that wanted to be with us.

Monica had managed to make Paul go out, even though he was kind of worried he was too old to hang out with us. Him and Loïc spent a good portion of the night talking god know about what. I was too busy drinking: for some reason everybody kept offering me shots and glasses! We danced and laughed with all the pilgrims there. We even talked with underaged girls all dressed up for halloween. Despite their age, they seemed quite familiar with the bartender; Spain seems more relaxed than France on that matter.

It was the only "party night" we shared before we reached Santiago, and it was quite a good one. I walked back Monica to her hostel around 2 or 3, when we were both too tired to stay out more. I was glad that she had a two-bed room because I really could not see myself stay out all night.
