I took my time that morning. My plan was to go to Porto by bus the day after, and once there to figure out how and when I would be going home. But for the time being, I intended to enjoy my last day in town with the friends I had made along the way: most of them should have made their way to Santiago by that time.

We went to have the free pilgrim lunch. Loïc also had the breakfast, and he told that there was a weird but funny hobo with him. I showed him a picture of the one that was at the bar the previous night and it was the same guy, as I expected. He was also there for the lunch: it was not especially good, but it was free food after all, so we had no right to be picky.

I booked my trip to Porto and rested for a good part of the afternoon, then went out and met with Elena and Dorothea for coffee, right before going for dinner with Krista and Loïc. Then it was bar hopping again, until I found the main group of pilgrims, all crammed at the end of a restaurant, drinking wine. Most of my camino "classmates" were there, something that didn't happen a lot: the italians, the girls, the mexicans, Monica and Becs, Sacha and the koreans...

I stayed there and drank a little with them then went on my own to A Gramola, the bar from the previous night, to see if Ben, Ollie and the others were still around and tell them to join us. They weren't though, and it was really quiet at that bar, but Jose was there and he was literally begging me to help him find Christian, Loïc and the others. I told him where the bar was but he wasn't able to find his way so ended up walking him there, even though I wanted to stay at Gramola to talk with Dorothea and the few people there.

And of course, once we reached the bar, they all had moved on and nobody was answering when I tried to join them... We tried a few bars randomly without any luck, only to learn that they all went to A Gramola... Had we stayed there in the first place, all would have been fine. Even more people were there, with Paul, Susan, Laurent and Amy as well. Only Ben and Ollie were missing, the first one having gone back home and the latter resting, according to his father. Even Jenny and the irishmen were there !

We stayed there and had fun until everybody started moving in different directions, with some going to a club. I tried to say with them but clubbing didn't appeal to me and around 4h, I went to bed for the last time.
