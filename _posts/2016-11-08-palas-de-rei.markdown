I woke up and left early, around the same time as Krista's, but we didn't stay together long. I was happy being on my own that day since I had planned a long one, around 42km. I ran into the irishmen and Jenny: they hadn't gone far after they left the hotel, it seemed!

I reached [Portomarín](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/27170+Portomar%C3%ADn,+Province+de+Lugo,+Espagne/@42.8081687,-7.620832,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xd302e2b247d7d65:0xd2e8841fc395301a!8m2!3d42.8074289!4d-7.6158428?hl=fr) around 11 and took an early lunch there, then I kept walking almost non-stop to [Palas de Rei](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/27200+Palas+de+Rei,+Province+de+Lugo,+Espagne/@42.874503,-7.8728645,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xd2fd4833bc446ff:0xec492e37a0acc43!8m2!3d42.8734481!4d-7.8687859?hl=fr). I didn't meet anyone I knew on the road which suited my plans just fine. I reached the city shortly before the end of the afternoon, as it was starting raining. I couldn't find the albergue I was looking for so I checked into a fancier one for once. No restrictions once again !

And it turned out that Krista also made it to Palas de Rei, though in another albergue; she finally had decided to walk without waiting for the others for once. We grabbed a quick beer before going to bed and she did seem to feel better and cheerful again!
