I took the morning very slowly, enjoying having my own space, no snorers, no alarms, nothing to bother me. Once I was ready to leave, I joined Loïc for a quick breakfast, then we joined Monica and Emilie for drinks and tapas. Spain is amazing in that regard: in many bars, you get a beer and a tapas and it will cost you between one and two euros. One could make a whole meal of it. Many tried to :)

Loïc decided not to stay one more night in Burgos and to walk to the next place, but I felt like staying one more night. I checked in to the same albergue that almost locked out my friends, then we went to visit the town's castle with Monica and Paul, a pilgrim from Seattle which had a fatherly vibe to him. I've met him mostly between Burgos and Leon, but we had many interesting conversations, and was as good a talker as he was a listener.

After the visit, we went for drinks and then for dinner with other pilgrims that weren't part of my usual group and were around 10/15 years older than Monica and I: it gave a family-dinner feeling to the whole thing, but in a good way :) After that, remembering the lesson from the previous night, it was time to go back to the albergue and sleep.
