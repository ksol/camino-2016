I woke up around 5h that morning, not really knowing why. I stayed in bed half-conscious until everybody was waking up, and of course they all took their time. I waited for Monica to get ready so we could grab a coffee, as it was starting to become part of the routine. We walked together until the entrance of [Burgos](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/Burgos,+Province+de+Burgos,+Espagne/@42.3441841,-3.7297983,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xd45fcbe3dc20327:0xa1f5beab8e71aa1!8m2!3d42.3440181!4d-3.6968994?hl=fr), where we took another coffee break.

I walked alone after, Monica needing some alone time. I caucht up with Krista and Saula who were walking with Manu and Stephan, the pilgrims that [I first met in Los Arcos]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2016-10-16-los-arcos.markdown %}). The lot of them had found a huge plush bear and were now carrying it around. They found him a name, then another one, then made up at least one (possibly more) backstory, the gist it being that the bear was still drunk and had to be carried from town to town until his alcoholism was cured. Don't ask me why :)

I didn't felt as cheerful as I used to be that morning. I can't say if it was the cloudy weather, the suburbs or something else, but there was definitely something. Monica joined again eventually, and we went for a burger before splitting away to our respective accomodations. I decided to book an airbnb and have some privacy for the first time in many weeks.

I was also hoping that people would be in the mood to stay up late that night but except Loïc and Christian, I was wrong. We drank a few beers with a few other pilgrims, until it was time for them to go back to their albergue... And we got there too late. It was barely after 22h but everything was closed! I contacted a friend that was inside the albergue but he could not open any door.

We wandered a bit and try to find another open albergue, without success. We came back to the first one and luckily, we managed to find a way in from the side alley... Had we waited a little bit more, the door to the alley would have been closed as well and either they were out for the night, or I would have had to bring them to my room! I'm glad I didn't have to impose that upon my host. Once I was sure they were in, it was time for me to walk back to my place and rest.
