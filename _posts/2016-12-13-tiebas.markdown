The night didn't magically cured me, I was sick for good. I decided to walk anyway, not wanting to feel behing or take a bus. The path to the first stop of the day was easy enough, but I could feel myself being weakened and not able to walk at my usual pace, so I spent most of the time alone, lost in my thoughts.

Between the illness, the grey weather and the lack of towns on the way, that day was pretty forgettable. I ended up in [Tiebas](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/31398+Tiebas,+Navarre,+Espagne/@42.6940969,-1.6424838,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xd509a81bab229db:0x58edc34d0ddf8724!8m2!3d42.6942332!4d-1.6386795?hl=fr) before the end of the afternoon and spent the rest of it in my bed, watching a tv show while resting.
