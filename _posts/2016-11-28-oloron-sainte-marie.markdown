We woke up quite early, our host being a student still. We grabbed a coffee with him, then said our goodbyes, and we found a place to do our first laundry of the trip. After that, it was time for a second breakfast, buying some food, and we went to the train station to join a town called Ogeu-les-bains.

We had very little interest into going back to Morlaas to follow exactly the path, and there wasn't any town that were interesting to go to except Oloron-Sainte-Marie, and that one was too far. So we went to Ogeu, and follow a very nice path along a river (the "gave d'Ossau") to Oloron. It was about three hours of walk and among the ones I enjoyed the most in France and maybe overall.

So yep. Technically we "cheated" and did not walk all the way, I know. Sue me. :)

Once we were in Oloron, we sent back home our unnecessary stuff in order to be lighter for the moutains. Then we bought some groceries again, and found a place to plant the tent in the football stadium. The club was having a meeting and they were kind enough to let us stay there.
