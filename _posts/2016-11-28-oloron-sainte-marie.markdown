We woke up quite early, our host still being a student. We grabbed a coffee with him then said our goodbyes, and we found a place to do our first laundry of the trip. After that, it was time for a second breakfast, buying some food, and we went to the train station to reach a town called [Ogeu-les-Bains](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/64680+Ogeu-les-Bains/@43.2286016,-0.488883,12z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0xd57acbfe80ab4db:0x406651748139620!8m2!3d43.1470275!4d-0.5057144?hl=fr).

We had very little interest into going back to [Morlaas](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/64160+Morlaas/@43.3354855,-0.3075054,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xd563825957bf68f:0x406651748139720!8m2!3d43.3453032!4d-0.262658?hl=fr) to follow exactly the path, and there wasn't any town that were interesting to go to except [Oloron-Sainte-Marie](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/64400+Oloron-Sainte-Marie/@43.1758622,-0.5621602,13z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0xd57aaacee6c8db9:0x406651748139610!8m2!3d43.1944141!4d-0.605278?hl=fr), and that one was too far to our taste. So we went to Ogeu and followed a very nice path along a river (the "gave d'Ossau") which was about three hours of walk. This walk is among the ones I enjoyed the most in France and maybe overall.

So yep. Technically we "cheated" and did not walk all the way, I know. Sue me. :)

Once we were in Oloron, we mailed back home our unnecessary stuff in order to be lighter for the moutains. Then we bought some groceries again, and found a place to plant the tent at the football stadium. The club was having a meeting and they were kind enough to let us stay there.
