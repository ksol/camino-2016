I woke up not really early, around 7, but after the dramas from the previous nights I decided it was time for me to move on. I was enjoying their company but felt that if I stretched it, it would only get worse and worse. I also knew that I was falling far behind my other friends so I resolved to catch up, however long it would be.

During the first days of the trip, Loïc and I would tell the other about our current readings. His was Kerouac's _On the Road_, and one specific passage resonated with me at that moment, the one where Neal has a tight schedule for his life, down to the minute. I though that it might help to do the same.

[Sahagún](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/24320+Sahag%C3%BAn,+Le%C3%B3n,+Espagne/@42.3708255,-5.032807,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xd47ff2fdeec7165:0x32d62fcb3c4a1764!8m2!3d42.3709738!4d-5.0300217?hl=fr), the town where I though my friends would be, was approximatively 50km away from where I was. Since it was almost 8h, I decided that should have walked 10km by 10h, 20 by 12h.. in order to arrived at 50km around 18h. It made for an average of 5km/hour, a pace I knew I could sustain. If I wanted to take breaks, I'd have to walk faster; the only rule being to keep my schedule.

And so I started to walk while it was still dark with a few stars over me and the sun slowly rising. I arrived in [Carrión de los Condes](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/34120+Carri%C3%B3n+de+los+Condes,+Province+de+Palencia,+Espagne/@42.3380353,-4.6097697,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xd47dafef82bb20b:0x88f095ac5a9a58d2!8m2!3d42.3373567!4d-4.6024132?hl=fr) around 9:30, took a quick coffee break and was walking again at 9:45. Around 12:30 I was in [Calzadilla de la Cueza](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/34309+Calzadilla+de+la+Cueza,+Province+de+Palencia,+Espagne/@42.3285756,-4.8069411,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xd47e67c107eabcb:0x13997fdbd1099016!8m2!3d42.3287276!4d-4.8044586?hl=fr), on time enough to allow myself a decent lunch break.

This part of the Camino is known as the _meseta_, long flat plains going approximatively from Burgos to Astorga. The lack of trees, towns and water points can make it challenging to walk those parts, especially when the weather's hot. It was the end of October so the weather was not too aggressive, but the pilgrims with less affinity with the sun than I were clearly not having as much fun as I was.

After my break, I started walking again, taking shorter breaks but more often, until I reached Sahagún earlier than planned, around 17h. Monica was pissed with me: she was proud of her day (the longest she had done) and there I was, I who had started before her and ended up way ahead of her... I reckon it was less funny for her than it was for me, but at the time I felt too good about myself to notice.

Anyway, I got to regroup with Loïc, Krista, Saula, part of the gang of italians, Manu and Stephan as well, and it was time for beers. It felt really good to have so many people impressed with what I achieved that day: having been overweight most of my adult life, the recognition of a physical achievement really meant something to me.

And then, there was the catch: everybody intended on moving on to the next city! 5 more kilometers to walk, and my body had cooled down and I was cramped... But I felt like taking the challenge and do the extra mile, or miles in that instance. I had to borrow a wooden staff though. We made our way to [Calzada del Coto](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/24342+Calzada+del+Coto,+Le%C3%B3n,+Espagne/@42.3882955,-5.0842096,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xd380092c7113c45:0x9c172ffa209ad7b6!8m2!3d42.3877122!4d-5.0799751?hl=fr) and arrived there around 19h. We got some food at the supermarket after Loïc had fun with a group of local kids and ate our dinner at the albergue, where we met Jem again.

Loïc also started having a weird idea for him: he decided that he would be running instead of walking tomorrow. He borrowed my shoes and booked a taxi for his backpack... Knowing that he never runs, I felt like he was asking for trouble, but after walking between 50 and 55km in day, who was I to judge.
