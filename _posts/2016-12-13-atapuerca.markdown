I started walking alone that morning: I needed to warm up and what better than a quick walk? I waited for the girls in the first town for a coffee, then walked with them for the rest of the day.

The path took us mainly through forrests, which was a nice change from the previous days where we were mostly in fields and hills. Our stop for the night is in [Atapuerca](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/09199+Atapuerca,+Province+de+Burgos,+Espagne/@42.3764125,-3.5102442,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xd45f18309ac2a71:0x96d5d8c672d4191e!8m2!3d42.3765537!4d-3.5072136?hl=fr). We found an albergue that was probably a barn at some point, but got converted. It felt very homey and cosy :)

A few pilgrims we knew arrived after us: Monica, Christian, Macarena... I remember finding the inspiration to write a one or two short stories before having dinner, a first since starting the hike. Before leaving, I had planned on using the free time to write more, but you know what tends to happen when plans meet reality.

We then went to the bar-restaurant next door, but I remember feeling quite tired so I went to bed early, leaving Monica, Christian and a few of the others. It seemed they had quite a night, though from the barn-albergue we couldn't hear a thing.
