It turned out the lake was quite the spot for cyclists. A few came by when were setting up the tent the night before, and some more when we were packing up and getting ready to leave. We left through the forest. The path was not bad, but god, there was so many mosquitos. We were dressed like terrorists, with bandanas masking our faces, and frankly I'm surprised that there wasn't a forest ranger to take us down.

But we got out alright, took a coffee break in [Pujaudran](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/32600+Pujaudran/@43.6354239,1.0537331,12z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x12a94c3493362cef:0x3beed9f03ece5d76!8m2!3d43.590643!4d1.149922?hl=fr]) (I assume we did, since we took coffees everywhere), and kept going until we reached [L'Isle-Jourdain](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/32600+L'Isle-Jourdain/@43.6354239,1.0537331,12z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x12a94fc06def2fff:0x440fe6f20e5dd7be!8m2!3d43.6138325!4d1.0817242?hl=fr) where we took our lunch in a fancy place (in front of a supermarket, eating tuna cans).

I don't remember much about that day and probably nothing special happened, except that the place where we planted our tent looked awesome. It was right at the exit of [Monferran-Savès](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/32490+Monferran-Sav%C3%A8s/@43.6142477,0.947653,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x12a9448192863591:0xeb3783a017e74c34!8m2!3d43.5981707!4d0.9824181?hl=fr), right next to the cemetery. There was this small fishing pond that mosquitos seemed to like, so we thought we might like it too. And we did! The sunset looked amazing.
