I left a bit earlier than everybody because I was craving coffee. I was not the only one but I was tired of waiting and I hoped they would join me at some point, but either they didn't, either they went some place else. In any case, that day promised to be physical again: I had a mountain to climb and I intended to be on top (around 1200m) by the end of the day.

There were at least three different paths leading to  [O Cebreiro](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/27671+O+Cebreiro,+Province+de+Lugo,+Espagne/@42.7078978,-7.0461348,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xd30f4367b715227:0xeebacbb084e79a91!8m2!3d42.7077948!4d-7.0436096?hl=fr): one following the road, one going through one smaller mountain before the big one, and one other with three mountains. I wanted to go through the three mountains but I had no idea where the path was and I ended up in the smaller mountain.

It looked like I was the only one up there: I knew Loïc would be taking the road due to his injury, but had no idea which road Gaby, Jem and Elena would be taking. Once I was high in the mountain I had a good view down the road and could see human shapes walking along the road. It didn't feel like a fun road to me, who was having lots of fun in the mountain in spite of the light rain and grey weather. I stopped at an albergue in the mountain for a coffee and the hostess was the loveliest person ever.

But good things always come to a end, and once I was down from the mountain I had to follow the road again. I walked with Jem, then Loïc and Mike, then Nora, until it was time to climb the mountain. It was hard here and there but over quicker than I thought. The entrance in O Cebreiro was quite something, though. There was a cloud atop the mountain and the whole area was very foggy; I couldn't see more than ten meters away. Combined to the lack of sound except the fallings leaves, it gave the place a surreal, almost mystical aura, as if I was walking into a place where no one is supposed to go.

But once inside the town itself, it looked more like a ski resort, with most houses beings restaurants or albergues. I took a coffee in the first that I found, and while I waited for Loïc I noticed that I had followed my schedule for 5 days in a row. If I kept this pace, Santiago was only 5 days away... But the weather for the coming days looked bad, grey and rainy most of the time and quite cold. I also wanted to see Saula and Krista again before the end, so maybe I would slow down a little.
