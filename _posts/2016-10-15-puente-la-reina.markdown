I woke up a bit hungover, but compared to Loïc I was in great shape. The rain had finally stopped so after breakfast I walked around the city and enjoyed it, while Loïc was resting and slowly made his come back to human form.

Early in the afternoon we took a bus back to [Puente la Reina](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/31100+Puente+la+Reina,+Navarre,+Espagne/@42.6719683,-1.8179815,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xd50879512bb724d:0x689d5755efe787f6!8m2!3d42.6722761!4d-1.8136024?hl=fr) and checked into one of the albergues. Loïc kept resting while I grabbed drinks with a few pilgrims I met at the albergue, and we both went to bed quite early.
