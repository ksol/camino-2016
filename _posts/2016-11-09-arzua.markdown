I woke up with a figurative slap in the face that morning: the result of the US elections were in and Trump was actually winning. I had talked about that topic with many americans I had met and all of them seemed confident that he would never get the job, but I guess everybody underestimated how voters mistrusted Clinton and how little they cared about all of Trump's awful behavior and declarations. The whole day was quite depressing.

I walked with Krista until [Melide](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/Melide,+Province+de+La+Corogne,+Espagne/@42.9133832,-8.0238948,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xd2e333d5fd265d1:0xbb2b9eb763cb4f54!8m2!3d42.9139435!4d-8.014698?hl=fr) but we didn't talk much. I was still under the shock, I think. I must have spent the whole day lost in my thoughts since I took almost no notes.

We ate a large pizza and walked again... and it was a mistake! We had had too much to eat and we were both feeling tired and in need of a nap... We managed to drag ourselves to  [Arzúa](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/Arz%C3%BAa,+Province+de+La+Corogne,+Espagne/@42.9286978,-8.1699185,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xd2e4a5c757bc3ff:0x9fae8a9ad70967cb!8m2!3d42.9296566!4d-8.1607819?hl=fr) and once there, didn't really do anything except rest.
