Waking up, we had a foggy view over [Auch](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/32000+Auch/@43.6626553,0.4965211,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x12a982b9687c606f:0x23818fc53ae6d13e!8m2!3d43.64638!4d0.586709?hl=fr), but as the sun got brighter the sky got clearer and the view better and better. We started walking around 10, Loïc still having troubles with his leg/ankle and I with my blisters.

We arrived at [Barran](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/32350+Barran/@43.6236423,0.41367,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x12a99009bd8bb37d:0x406f69c2f410c20!8m2!3d43.6162599!4d0.442952?hl=fr) around 14 and took our lunch break around the church, as well as a nap. The break was long because we were waiting for the supermarket to open. What we didn't notice is that it wasn't open on mondays... The sign was unreadable unless you were right in front of it.

We cursed it and then moved on to [L'Isle-de-Noé](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/32300+L'Isle-de-No%C3%A9/@43.5867203,0.3933485,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x12a990e2e4d2099b:0x20911559b9506328!8m2!3d43.5867636!4d0.4131031?hl=fr), which had the same issue - no store opened on mondays. We were getting low on food but had just enough to hold on until the day after. We ran into Daniel & François again, something that would happend pretty much every day until they stopped walking.

The city had a kind of castle with a large park, and that's where we planted the tent, in a spot a bit away from everything. We were getting better and setting up the tent quickly and finding a good spot before it was dark, as well as getting used to sleeping in a tent most of the time.
