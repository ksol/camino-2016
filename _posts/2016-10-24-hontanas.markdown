It rained when we left town after our coffee. We had grey weather here and there, but until then it had only rained when we were taking a break, in cities. We had been lucky enough to always walk under good weather, sunny most of the time; so it seems only fair that after a month of having it easy we would at least suffer one day of shitty weather.

And obviously, every time it stopped raining and made me feel it was ok to take off my rain gear, it started raining again right away. The perfect annoying morning :) We stopped around noon for lunch and were joined by Paul and Amy. Once we were done, I stormed off on my own, wanting to be over with this day as soon as possible.

And it only got worse and worse. It had stopped raining, but the path to the next town was going through fields, and what would have been regular dirt under the sun was now mud, with no solid footing nowhere. It pissed me off, so I tried to go faster, but the more I tried, the more it felt useless. Had I been smart I would have calmed down, but I didn't and stayed pissed until I reached Hontanas. I only cooled down once I had a beer :)

Loïc, Krista and Saula were ahead in another town so I checked in the first place that seemed good enough. I met a few new pilgrims there, including France, from France (or as I wrote in my notebook, maybe it was the other way around), Sean from New Zealand, and Aaron from England. We had dinner together and then it was time for me to sleep.
