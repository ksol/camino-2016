I woke up not as hungover as I thought I would be, but the same could be said about everybody. Once they were awake and clear headed, the tension from the night earlier was defused and everything was well again. I started walking with Corry, Adelina and Stera. At first, she'd come off as being complaining all the time (which she is, most of the time), but if you get past that, she is actually a nice and interesting person.  

Adelina and I were walking slowlier. Though I wasn't hungover, I wasn't feeling at my top either so I thought it was best to talk it slow. We talked about books we both had read, shows we had watched, and the drama from the earlier night. At some point we ran into Susan and Laurent who teased me about my ability to always end up in the company of pretty girls...

We took a few breaks here and there, and while we were walking next to a river we saw on the distance a place with tipis. We considered going to see what it was but it was not on the road and we thought it best not to let the others go to far ahead of us. One or two hours later, while walking next to a road, we hear screams coming from the road and then see a car filled with people making signs towards us. It was Stera, Corry, and two other pilgrims!

They had stopped at the tipi place and they had loved it so much they wanted to stop there for the day, even though it barely the afternoon and we hadn't walked 15kms. They had borrowed the owner's car and went to look for us! I was unsure about following them because it felt like a step back, but I also felt that I might be missing out on something fun, so I went along. We went in the next city, [Carrión de los Condes](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/34120+Carri%C3%B3n+de+los+Condes,+Province+de+Palencia,+Espagne/@42.3380353,-4.6097697,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xd47dafef82bb20b:0x88f095ac5a9a58d2!8m2!3d42.3373567!4d-4.6024132?hl=fr) to run some errands, then went back to the tipis.

The place was lovely indeed, with goats, horses and ducks running freely around. Monica was shortly there to take a break, too. We spent the afternoon drinking beers, learning knife throwing, playing with balls... That albergue was really nice. The owner seemed very carefree: I tried to check-in and pay many times but he was nowhere to be seen!

After cooking our dinner, we went and made a fire outside, a  nameless one since Loïc wasn't there to witness its greatness. We shared stories, smokes and drinks, until at some point the drama from the previous night got reignited, though with less intensity. At some point I had my share of it and went to bed. Two drama in two nights was more than enough for me.
