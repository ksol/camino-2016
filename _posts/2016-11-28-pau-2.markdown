It felt good not to have to wake up early to walk for once. We stayed in late in the morning until our host had to leave for the week-end. Lo誰c state had gone worse, though. His own theory: he drank too much and forgot to be careful with his ankle, and now he was feeling it more than ever. The break was having the opposite effect than the one intended...

The afternoon went by slowly. We took it slow, relaxing in coffees and bars, visiting a little as well. By 18h though, I was starting to be worried that we didn't have any plans for sleeping that night. I wasn't sure we could plant the tent in the city parks, and even then the weather was not warm and it started raining. Lo誰c didn't seem to care very much, though. But then again I'm more "precious" than he is so it wasn't a big surprise.

Lo誰c had spotted a bar that was supposed to have a jazz band playing that night, so that was his plan, and hopefully meet people and a host there. I kept hesitating on going along or getting a last-minute airbnb.. And then the concert started and there was pretty much nobody except us, the waiters and the band. So I finished my beer and booked an airbnb with a very nice hostess for such short notice, and Lo誰c joined me after the concert.
